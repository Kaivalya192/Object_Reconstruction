place them under `./BundleSDF/BundleTrack/LoFTR/weights/`


## 2) Docker Setup

To set up the Docker environment, run the following command:

```bash
docker build --network host -t nvcr.io/nvidian/bundlesdf .
```
## 3) Methodology
### Capture Data from RealSense Depth Camera

To capture data from a RealSense depth camera, run the `rec_con_mask.py` script.

<br>1)Install [librealsense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) 
<br>2)Install dependencies for Xmem and Realsense
<br> conda environment (optional) 
```bash
conda create -n obj_recon python=3.10
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Prepare Input Directory

```bash
bash capture.sh
```
<br>Note : (Don't run in Docker Container)<br/>

Press `Enter` to start recording RGB and depth frames. Then, create a boundary by selecting points on the window to create a mask for the first image.

### Steps to Run

1. Run the container:

    ```bash
    bash run_container.sh
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```bash
    bash build.sh
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    ```
